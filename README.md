# ðŸŽ¥ MoviesAtlas Project

MovieAtlas is a movie search website that helps users discover films through different filters. The main goal is to provide a user-friendly way to explore movies and learn about their cast, making it easy to find films that match users' interests.

This project was built using Django as the backend framework, Bulma CSS for styling, and SQLite as the database.

The project consists of two main areas: Account Domain and Movies Domain.
â€¢	Account Domain: handles user actions like login, logout, and registration.
â€¢	Movies Domain is the core, where we manage all things movie-related.
